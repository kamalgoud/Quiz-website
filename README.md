# Quiz-website
This project contains different types of quizzes made up of html, css and js . Shows questions and answers and shows marks at the end 
In html I used various tags like images, links, table, input tags. I used input tags to take input answers from participant.
In css I styled all these tags, I changed the background colors, height and widths of every element and made the website to look attractive.

I provided one navigation bar, on clicking the elements on that bar we move to different parts of that page.
I used one form to the participant to provide the contact details and to submit the form, as soon as participants provide the details 
and clicked on submit button there will be alert dialog box saying that form submitted successfully.
And there is feedback form to provide feedback, after submission of feedback there will  be another dialog box saying 
that feedback submitted successfully.

With Java Script I provided the functionalities. I made questions and answers in js. And took the answers from the participant and 
checked the selected option whether it is matched with the correct answer or not, if it is matched with correct on I incremented thr result,
And at the end I showed the result and provided one button to move to the home to attempt the other quiz.
